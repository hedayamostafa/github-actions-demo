# GitHub Actions Demo - Proof of Concept

This repository is a demonstration of GitHub Actions to showcase the concepts and basic usage of continuous integration and automation in a GitHub project. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. This repository serves as a minimal example to help you get started with GitHub Actions.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is an automation and continuous integration (CI) service offered by GitHub. It enables you to automate tasks in your software development workflows, including building, testing, and deploying your code. It's based on a combination of workflows, triggers, and actions.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is designed to demonstrate the core concepts and basic usage of GitHub Actions for the following scenarios:

1. **Build and Test**: Automatically build and test your code every time you push changes to the repository.

2. **Create Release**: Automatically create a release whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.

3. **Scheduled Jobs**: Set up scheduled jobs for various tasks, such as cleanup or reporting.

## Getting Started

To use GitHub Actions for your own projects, you can follow these steps:

1. **Fork or Clone this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account or clone it to your local machine.

2. **Modify the Workflow Files**: Review the workflow files located in the `.github/workflows` directory to understand how different actions are configured. Customize these files to suit your project's needs.

3. **Create and Manage Secrets**: If your workflows require secrets or environment variables, you can manage them in the repository's settings under the "Secrets" section.

4. **Push Changes**: Make changes to your code and push them to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflows defined in your workflow files.

5. **Check Workflow Status**: Visit the "Actions" tab on your repository to monitor the status and results of your workflows.

6. **Explore and Experiment**: Experiment with GitHub Actions to automate your own development and deployment processes. Explore the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) for pre-built actions that you can include in your workflows.

## Workflow Files

This repository includes the following workflow files:

1. **`.github/workflows/build.yml`**: This workflow runs on every push to the repository and demonstrates how to build and test the code.

2. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: This workflow is triggered when a new tag is pushed to the repository. It demonstrates how to create a release on GitHub.

3. **`.github/workflows/scheduled-jobs.yml`**: This workflow sets up scheduled jobs to run at specified intervals. It serves as an example for recurring tasks in your automation pipeline.
